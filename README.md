Introducing TestVerse - The Visual Wikipedia for Software Testing

I've built an interactive galaxy where you can explore 100+ testing tools and frameworks visually.

âœ¨ Features:
- 26 Testing Categories (API, Browser, Mobile, Performance, Security, CI/CD, etc.)
- 100+ Tools with direct links to documentation
- Visual connections showing how tools relate
- Search functionality to find tools quickly

Goal: Make testing knowledge accessible, visual, and connected.

Try it live: What tool would you add? ðŸ‘‡
